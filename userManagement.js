Ah
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 1:51 PM
dom do you remember where we got the admin login information in postman?
Dominic W ‚Äî 1:52 PM
Login i think
Dominic W ‚Äî 2:23 PM
Any updates to tithub?
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 2:26 PM
nope
oh tom should he made the author page functional with get requests but I still cannot get post request working
changed your login and userHelper.js to not do hardcheck for admin account name
but admin status is still wrong something to do with postman I think but debugging rn
Dominic W ‚Äî 2:33 PM
Hmm
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 2:55 PM
admin status always shows false so we are not logging in as admin something to do with the backend
Image
Dominic W ‚Äî 2:56 PM
Im so confused
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 2:59 PM
so in the login code you made it was hardcoded to see if the account name matches adminAccount then we are redirected to the adminAccount page but I changed it so that it actually checks the login info. In app.js you set it up as that if we use the login function (which we now do), it will check the isAdmin status, if it is true, we can go to the adminAccount page if not we are redirected to account settings page
Dominic W ‚Äî 3:00 PM
oh right okay
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 3:00 PM
did you know you hardcoded the admin login check?
Dominic W ‚Äî 3:00 PM
yes i thought it was the only admin user
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 3:01 PM
there is another one called bob but we dont know his password, but regardless its set up like that that user creation using POST requests only works with the backend if youre logged in as an admin
but rn admin status is false so even tho its seeing that the password and username is correct its still not recognising it properly idky
Dominic W ‚Äî 3:02 PM
ohhh okay
upload ur updated login to github so i can have a look
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 3:03 PM
okay
Dominic W ‚Äî 3:04 PM
good job finding that, i didnt even think to look at the user list to see if there was another admin
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 3:05 PM
i added login and userhelper
because both use the hardcoded check
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 3:07 PM
tom found that, but doesnt matter, we need authentication from database as an admin to be able to do post requests for user creation thats how they set up the databse, so we cannot just manually go to the admin settings
Dominic W ‚Äî 3:08 PM
righto
so after your update logging in as adminAccount goes to accountsettings page
is that correct?
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 3:10 PM
yeah
Dominic W ‚Äî 3:13 PM
okay
why
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 3:14 PM
because admin status is false
Adams ‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî 3:17 PM
And your code Dom uses a check where if admin is true go to admin page, if false go to account settings
In the function that handles the navigation for the login button
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 3:17 PM
yeah
okay wait
we arent the only ones
nicks got the same issue as me
somethings wrong with the database idk what to do neither does he
Adams ‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî 3:18 PM

we cannot log in as an admin
to be able to create a user you need to be able to login as an admin
so cannot create users
cannot update users, cannot delete users
we can get
no patch no delete
so no item management
Hi All, 

I am just putting you all in the same email thread as you all seem to be getting similar/the same error code. 

I've been up all night trying to find the error in the back-end and I have tried to replicate the error on my end, but it does not seem to effect the app on my side. 

I know this is hugely stressful and highly inconvenient - I've seen most of your work thus far so rest assured if this truly a back-end thing that I cannot fix by due date I wont take off marks (and we can talk extensions if needed). 

In the meantime, you send me screenshots of the errors, your docker set up, and the JS code that was written? 

I'd recommend to just keep coding like you have access to the back-end - just put a comment around it so I know its either untested/not connected. Worst case scenario, I can mark off that and the knowledge that I have of your apps thus far. 

I will keep you updated as I work to get this sorted out and I apologise for the stress and inconvenience, this is that tricky part of this kind of development, because no two solutions are the same the blanket solution doesn't work for everyone. 

I do know that you don't need the auth folder anymore - having this causes more issues as this is now handled by the backend. Other than that I will keep digging and if you can send me the screenshots I can double check everything from my side. 

I will keep you posted - I know Mac and Nick have done their demos but Haeun we can always postpone yours if we don't have this sorted out by next Thursday.

Kind regards, 

Jacqueline

@Dominic W can you follow the week 9 lab for deleting auth folder, and then changing the build./auth to the image (which I know you have already done but do it again please) and then use the updated code and try to see if you can then login as an admin, and then are able to get to adminAccount page instead of acc settings page
let me know, because the new image worked for you but I remember you did not delete the auth folder when I asked you last thursday
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 3:58 PM
@Dominic W can you please sit in a call tonight after you get back, because I think you may be actually able to talk to the database
Dominic W ‚Äî 5:13 PM

Dominic W ‚Äî 6:30 PM
This is a backend API bug, not a problem with your React frontend code. You cannot fix this from your React application.

The error message Cannot insert explicit value for identity column in table 'Patrons' means the backend code is trying to manually set a UserID (e.g., UserID: 10) when it creates a new user in the Patrons table.

The database is configured to automatically generate this UserID for every new user, so it's rejecting the manual value.

How to Fix It (For the Backend Developer)
The developer of the backend API (the auth service) needs to change their code.

They must find the SQL query that inserts a new user into the [dbo].[Patrons] table and remove the UserID column and its value from the INSERT statement.

Example of the bug:

-- WRONG (This is what the backend is probably doing)
INSERT INTO [dbo].[Patrons] (UserID, Email, Name, Salt, HashPW) 
VALUES (5, 'test@email.com', 'Test User', '...', '...'); 


Example of the fix:

-- RIGHT (This is what the backend *should* be doing)
INSERT INTO [dbo].[Patrons] (Email, Name, Salt, HashPW) 
VALUES ('test@email.com', 'Test User', '...', '...');


By removing UserID from the query, the database will automatically assign the next available ID, and the error will be resolved.

there is nothing we can do...
Image
we do not have access to the auth folder
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 6:31 PM
Yeah I know
That‚Äôs what I was saying lol
Dominic W ‚Äî 6:31 PM
Yeah but I already said this to you last week
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 6:32 PM
Yeah but then jaq said she fixed it
Some people can still use the fix to do it
I couldn‚Äôt so I thought maybe something on my end is wrong
But you could run the docker compose commands with the updated compose.yml file
So thought maybe if you got rid of the auth folder like they said in week 9 and because I‚Äôm the email jaq said having the auth folder causes more issues, I thought you could delete it and then run the docker compose up and down commands and see if you can access
Dominic W ‚Äî 6:36 PM
yeah i did that
in week 9...
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 6:36 PM
I asked you last week and you said you didn‚Äôt delete anything üò≠üò≠
Dominic W ‚Äî 6:37 PM
yeah last week i didn't but you making me go through lab 9 again made me remember it
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 6:37 PM
Oh well we tried
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 6:37 PM
Fair
Okay we just keep writing the code as if we can access it
Dominic W ‚Äî 6:38 PM
i dont understand how every single get command is fucked
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 6:38 PM
We may have to get rid of the logic where if isAdmin status is false we go to account settings
And always make it navigate to admin account page
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 6:39 PM
Wdym
They are working post isn‚Äôt working
Dominic W ‚Äî 6:39 PM
sorry i mean post
all of them except for login and logout
make it make sense
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 6:40 PM
Oh right yeah
Apparently we can do successful get requests for users don‚Äôt know how because we have no users
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 6:41 PM
Get requests are easier because nothing is getting changed but post and patch you need to make changes
Dominic W ‚Äî 6:41 PM
there are 5 users
mystic_banana_bread ‚Äî 6:42 PM
Ohhh yes I forgot lol
